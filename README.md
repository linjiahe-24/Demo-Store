# Aura Performance Store

## Project Overview
This is a premium e-commerce frontend for "Aura Performance," a futuristic sportswear brand.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main landing page.
- `css/style.css`: Custom styles (Dark/Neon theme).
- `js/app.js`: Interactive UI logic.
- `assets/images/`: Images resources.

## How to Run
Since this is a static project, you can simply:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
2. OR, if you have a local server extension (like Live Server in VS Code), use that to serve the project root.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.
- **Glassmorphism**: Modern translucent UI elements.
- **Micro-animations**: Hover effects and add-to-cart feedback.
